- You can add new features to your liking
- Your submission would be reviewed based on these criteria:
  - Performance
  - Code quality
  - Tooling choices
  - Additional features
- To submit your work, deploy the app to a public cloud and give us the URL. Youâ€™ll also need to send us the link of the repository containing the required source to us and we are willing to have a look on how you build the system step by step
- DO NOT copy a solution. If we found your work is exactly same with another candidate, we may have to terminate the review process
